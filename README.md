# 2D Infinite Runner Game (C++ & OpenGL)

## Portfolio Project: Infinite Runner Game

### Project Overview

As part of my portfolio, I developed an engaging 2D infinite runner game using C++ and OpenGL. This project showcases my game development skills and offers an exciting gameplay experience for players.

### General Concept

In this project, I crafted a 2D infinite runner game that immerses players in a thrilling experience. The game starts with a visually appealing backdrop featuring three distinct lanes. A central character/object remains at the center lane, providing a focal point for the player's journey. The character stays stationary while the background moves continuously, creating the illusion of forward motion. Players assume control of the character, guiding it through obstacles and collecting valuable coins.

### Obstacle Dodging

The game introduces a dynamic obstacle system. Obstacles descend from the top to the bottom of the screen, appearing randomly in different lanes. To succeed, players must maneuver the character to avoid collisions with these obstacles. Quick thinking and precise control are essential for navigating the ever-changing landscape. Colliding with an obstacle results in the character losing one life. Players start with a total of three lives, adding a layer of strategy to the game.

### Coin Collection

To boost the excitement and challenge, I integrated a coin collection mechanism. Coins materialize at random positions within the lanes. Collecting a coin instantly adds one point to the player's score. However, coins are less abundant than obstacles, emphasizing the importance of strategic decisions. For every five points scored, the game's speed escalates by 1.5, enhancing the gameplay's intensity. Additionally, players earn an extra life for reaching this milestone.

### Tracking Lives & Scores

The game provides players with a clear view of their progress. The number of remaining lives is prominently displayed on the screen, allowing players to gauge their resilience. Losing a life is visually represented, creating tension and anticipation. Collecting five points triggers a speed boost and an extra life, motivating players to strive for higher scores. The player's current score is constantly updated and visible throughout the game.

## Design & Animation

- I implemented the main character/object using a combination of at least three different primitive shapes, showcasing my design skills.
- The game features captivating background scenes that move continuously to simulate character motion.
- A variety of obstacles, composed of a minimum of two primitives, challenge players as they descend from the top of the screen.
- To enhance the game's visual appeal, I designed a coin object with at least one primitive shape for collection.
- I skillfully displayed lives on the screen, ensuring players can easily track their progress.
- The lanes, crucial for character navigation, are defined using a visually appealing primitive, resembling real-world side-walks.

## Animation & Sound

- Character/object movement is seamlessly animated as players control its position within the lanes using left and right arrow keys.
- Engaging animations, such as rotation, are incorporated into either the obstacles or coins, adding depth to the gameplay.
- The background is thoughtfully animated to create a convincing sense of character motion.
- A comprehensive sound system complements the gameplay, providing auditory feedback for various in-game actions. Whether it's avoiding obstacles or collecting coins, the sound effects enhance the gaming experience.

## How to Install

To install and play the game on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

``` git clone https://github.com/Ziaad-Khaled/infinite-runner-opengl.git ```

2. Navigate to the project directory: 
``` cd infinite-runner-opengl ```

3. Compile the C++ source code with your preferred compiler that supports OpenGL.

4. Run the compiled executable to start the game.

Enjoy playing the 2D infinite runner game!
